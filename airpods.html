            <p>The new Apple-designed H2 chip is the force behind AirPods Pro and its advanced audio performance. It
                works
                in concert
                with a custom-built driver and amplifier to deliver crisp, clear high notes and deep, rich bass in
                stunning
                definition —
                so every sound is more vivid than ever.
                The brand-new H2 chip carries out more functions than ever, using computational algorithms to deliver
                even
                smarter noise
                cancellation, superior three-dimensional sound, and more efficient battery life — all at once. </p>

            <img src="./picture/audio_airpod_guts_bottom__bfet1uy1eg0y_large (1).jpg">
            <p>Featuring up to two times more noise cancellation than their predecessor, the H2-powered AirPods Pro are
                built to let
                you listen in peace. With control over what you hear — and don't hear — you'll be immersed in songs and
                podcasts like
                never before. A new driver and improved acoustic algorithms help Active Noise Cancellation reduce more
                unwanted noise, so nothing
                interrupts listening during your commute and when you need to focus.</p>

                press to play
                and pause music or answer and end calls, or hold to switch between Active Noise Cancellation and

            <p>The new MagSafe Charging Case is loaded with features that make listening on the move especially
                convenient.
                An updated
                design offers more ways to keep track of the case, and extended battery life lets you listen, watch, and
                talk longer
                between charges. You won't find a more capable case.</p>
