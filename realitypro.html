            <p>Apple has been experimenting with virtual reality and augmented reality technologies for almost 20 years
                based on
                patent filings, but with virtual and augmented reality exploding in popularity with the launch of ARKit,
                Apple's
                dabbling is growing more serious and is expected to lead to the first wearable AR/VR Apple device in
                2023.
                There
                is a research at Apple with hundreds of employees working on AR and VR and exploring ways the emerging
                technologies could be used in future Apple products. AR/VR hiring has ramped up over the last several
                years,
                and
                Apple has acquired multiple AR/VR companies as it furthers its work in the AR/VR space.

            <p>The AR/VR headset will be a standalone device with Apple silicon chips that will put performance on par
                with
                Apple's Macs. It will have two chips inside that will allow it to perform complex tasks and handle the
                virtual
                reality
                capabilities, plus it will be able to operate independently of an iPhone or a Mac. Pairing will be
                possible
                to
                use the iPhone as a keyboard and to transfer data, but it won't be required.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Apple is designing an App Store for the headset, and content will focus on gaming, streaming video, and
                video
                conferencing. It will run "xrOS," a new operating system designed specifically for the headset. A
                FaceTime
                experience will use the cameras to project a person's full face and body into a virtual environment for
                one-on-one calls,
                and there will also be other apps like Calendar, Mail, Safari, and more. The headset will have an
                iOS-like
                interface that will be immediately familiar to iPhone and iPad users, with a
                dedicated Home Screen that houses an array of apps and widgets. It will also be able to be used as a
                display
                for
                a
                connected Mac, with the Mac's mouse and keyboard used as input devices.</p>

            <p>Like iOS for iPhone, macOS for Mac, and tvOS for Apple TV, the Apple VR headset could run something
                called
                "rOS"
                or "xrOS." A trademark filed by a company called "Realityo Systems LLC" was filed for something called
                realityOS
                to
                be published on June 8, 2022, suspiciously close to the WWDC keynote taking place on June 6, though that
                didn't
                pan
                out into anything. Mark Gurman shared information about the internal project, saying Apple had chosen
                the
                name
                "xrOS" for the
                operating system used in Apple VR. An initial announcement was rumored to take place in January 2023,
                but
                that
                didn't
                happen. Ming-Chi Kuo suggested that the hardware manufacturing was on schedule for mass production in
                2023,
                but
                the xrOS
                development may push the hardware release later into the year.</p>
