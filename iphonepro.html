            <p>Dynamic Island bubbles up music, sports scores, phone calls, and so much more — without taking you away
                from what you’re

            <p>You can see your next turn in Maps, touch and hold to control your music, and keep an eye on your Uber

                with friends.</p>
            <p>It's integrated throughout iOS — and works with lots of different apps — to seamlessly surface what you

            <p>The advanced quad-pixel sensor on the Main camera makes the most of 48 megapixels by adapting to what
                you're shooting.</p>
            <p>Shooting in ProRAW at 48MP delivers 4x the resolution for jaw-dropping cropping.</p>
            <p>The Pro camera system adds a 2x Telephoto with optical-quality zoom, giving you more framing flexibility
                than ever.</p>
            <p>The new Photonic Engine preserves even more image data to deliver brighter, more lifelike colors and
                beautifully
                detailed textures — in much less light.</p>

            <p>If you try to call 911 but don't have cell service or Wi-Fi, iPhone lets you text emergency services over
                satellite.5</p>
            <p>iPhone shows you where to point to maintain your connection. You must be outdoors with a clear view of
                the sky — and
                avoid obstructions such as mountains and heavy foliage.</p>
            <p>Since every second counts, iPhone front-loads a few questions to assess your situation — just tap to
                respond.
                Satellites are moving targets with low bandwidth, so it can take minutes for messages to get through.
            </p>
            <p>If you're on an adventure without cell service, you can use Find My to share your location via satellite
                so friends and
                family know where you are.</p>

            <p>iPhone 14 Pro can detect a severe car crash, then call 911 and notify your emergency contacts.6

                Hardware sensors and advanced motion algorithms identify signs of a crash — including sudden changes in
                speed,
                direction, and cabin pressure.</p>
