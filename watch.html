        <p class="macandwatchfeatures">Apple Watch can do what your other devices can't because it's on your wrist. When
            you wear it, you get a
            fitness partner
            that measures all the ways you move, meaningful health insights, and a connection to the people and things
            you care
            about most.</p>

            <p class="macandwatchfeatures">It has your heart in mind.
                Unusually high or low heart rates and irregular heart rhythms (known as
                arrhythmias) could be signs of a
                serious
                condition.4 But many people don't recognize the symptoms, so the underlying causes often go undiagnosed.
                Notifications
                in the Heart Rate app will alert you to these irregularities so you can take action and consult your
                doctor.
